You can define your own podcast list by several ways:

Copy the file /etc/podcast/podcast.xml, name it podcast_user.xml and it will not be overwritten by updates. Change to your needs.

You can also replace the content of podcast_user.xml by a URL which points to a remote file (i.e. stored in Wuala, Dropbox or similar). This allows you to edit the file without touching your receiver again.

You can use an account on feedly.com: create a collection called "PodcastPlugin", assign this tag to every podcast you want to see on your receiver. Now go to "Organize" and scroll down to "Save as OPML"; click on it for the link to appear. Either download the file and copy it as "feedly.opml" to /etc/podcast, OR copy the URL, paste it into a file and store this file as etc/podcast/feedly.opml. Pasted as an URL, you can edit your feeds on Feedly, and whatever you tag with "PodcastPlugin" will be instantly available on your device.
